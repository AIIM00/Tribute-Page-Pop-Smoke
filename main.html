                <h3>The life of Bashar Barakah Jackson</h3>
                <p>Pop Smoke was born as Bashar Barakah Jackson on July 20, 1999 in Brooklyn, New York. His mother is Jamaican and his father is Panamanian. He has a brother, Obasi Jackson, who is also a music artist. Bashar grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn and he attended nine different schools. He was expelled from the eighth grade for bringing a gun to school. Because of this, Pop Smoke was put on house arrest for two years and he had to wear an ankle bracelet during this period. He was only allowed to go to school while he was on house arrest. Bashar claimed that this is the only reason why he was able to get his diploma. 
                    
                    At 15 years old, he received a basketball scholarship to a prep school in Philadelphia, but unfortunately he was forced to stop playing competitive basketball due the fact that he was diagnosed with a heart murmur 6 months into the program. In an interview with XXL Pop said that he returned to Canarsie after this and turned to street life. At the age of just 16, Bashar was already driving a BMW 5 series.
                    
                    Pop Smoke explained in an interview with the LA Leakers that coming from the hood, there are three options to survive and make it out of there: to rap, play ball or sell drugs. Pop said that he did all of them and that he was good at it. Before he started rapping, he was playing ball and later he turned to street life since he was not permitted to play competitive basketball. However, a chance to get out of the street life appeared in 2018 during a studio session with rapper and friend Jay Gwuapo.

                <h3>Music Career</h3>
                <p>Pop Smoke's music career actually started by accident. During a studio session in 2018, with friend and rapper Jay Gwuapo, Gwuapo fell asleep because he was too high on drugs. Having already paid for the studio session, Pop went up and picked up the mic to try rapping for the first time. He started making remixes to popular songs within the Brooklyn drill scene by looking up beats on YouTube. One of these beats would end being Pop Smoke’ first song that was ever released: ‘MPR’, which is a remix to Sheff G’s ‘Panic Part 3′. MPR gained a lot of streams and views in just a few days. In January 2019, he released Flexin’ and after that his music career (and popularity) skyrocketed.
                    
                    He became friends with Rico Beats, an acquaintance of Steven Victor. Steven is owner of Victor Victor Worldwide, which is a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Pop Smoke signed to Victor Victor Worldwide in April 2019. This was also the month that Pop Smoke released ‘Welcome To The Party’, which would gain him mainstream success. It was one of the hottest singles during the summer of 2019 and it was streamed all over the world. The song would even gain more attention due the two remixes that were made: one featuring Nicki Minaj and one with British rapper Skepta.
                    
                    Pop Smoke released his first mixtape, Meet The Woo, on July 26, 2019. His second mixtape, Meet The Woo 2, would follow on February 7, 2020. His debut studio album, Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon would posthumously be released on July 3, 2020.</p>
                <h3>Dominating presence in the drill music world</h3>
                <p>Pop Smoke was one of the pioneering rappers from Brooklyn who embraced UK drill beats, playing a key role in connecting the drill scenes of the UK and New York. While he wasn’t the first New York artist to use UK drill beats, he perfected their use, propelling the Brooklyn drill sound onto the global stage. This achievement solidified Pop Smoke's status as the figurehead of Brooklyn drill and a dominant force in the drill genre worldwide.
                    Pop frequently collaborated with UK-based producer 808Melo. His journey into music began with a search for drill beats on YouTube, where he discovered 808Melo’s work. Initially, Pop Smoke used the beats without payment, but after 808Melo realized Pop was gaining significant attention with them, he approached the rapper to discuss compensation. Unaware of the oversight, Pop believed his management had handled it. Instead of offering money, Pop invited 808Melo to New York to collaborate on his debut mixtape, Meet The Woo. The duo went on to create several hit tracks together, including Dior, Welcome To The Party, and Gatti.

                <h3>How did Pop Smoke come up with his artist name?</h3>
                <p>In a Genius interview, Pop Smoke revealed that his stage name is a blend of two nicknames: ‘Papa’ and ‘Smoke Oh Guap.’ His grandmother affectionately called him ‘Papa,’ while his childhood friends referred to him as ‘Smoke Oh Guap.’ Since his friends didn’t want to call him Papa, they shortened it to ‘Pop.’ Over time, ‘Pop’ and ‘Smoke’ naturally came together, creating the name that would later become famous worldwide: Pop Smoke.</p>
                <h3>Pop Smoke's Death</h3>
                <p>Pop Smoke was tragically murdered during a home-invasion robbery in Hollywood, Los Angeles on February 19, 2020. Pop Smoke was visiting Los Angeles to celebrate the release of Meet The Woo 2 and to promote the mixtape which dropped on February 7. For the visit he and a few friends were renting a multi-million dollar mansion in Hollywood via AIRbnb. On the 19th of February, around 4:30 A.M., at least four hooded men broke into the house, including one person carrying a handgun. There were multiple people inside the house besides Pop Smoke, but the burglars only ran into Pop Smoke. The person carrying the handgun shot Pop Smoke twice in his torso, which ended up being fatal.
                    
                    The LAPD got a call about the home-invasion from the East Coast and arrived six minutes later at the mansion. Pop Smoke was brought to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where doctors opened up the left side of his chest in an attempt to save his life. Unfortunately, it had no impact and Pop Smoke was announced dead at the same hospital where another Brooklyn legend (Biggie Smalls) lost his life. Pop Smoke’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso. It is really sad to realize that Pop Smoke survived the hood in Brooklyn and ended up dying in Hollywood at such a brutal way and young age.</p>

                <h3>Posthumous Album Release</h3>
                <p>On May 14, Steven Victor announced the release date for Pop Smoke’s debut studio album, set for June 12, 2020. 50 Cent, who was deeply invested in finishing the project, came on board as the album's executive producer. Initially, Steven Victor struggled with the emotional weight of listening to Pop Smoke's music after his passing. However, 50 Cent’s encouragement and dedication helped push the project forward, ensuring that Pop Smoke’s debut album would still see a summer release, as he had always envisioned.

                    Originally scheduled for June 12, 2020, the release of Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon was postponed due to the death of George Floyd, out of respect. On that day, the album’s lead single, “Make It Rain” featuring Rowdy Rebel, was released—marking the first single with Pop Smoke as the lead since his death.
                    
                    The album was eventually released on July 3, 2020. Complex published an insightful article detailing the creation of each track on the album. Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon became one of the biggest albums of 2020, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 251,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. This achievement made Pop Smoke the first hip-hop artist to posthumously debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with a debut album.
                    
                    On July 20, what would have been Pop Smoke’s 21st birthday, the deluxe edition of the album was released. For more details about the album, visit the <a href="discography.html" target="_blank">Pop Smoke: Discography page!</a>
